# Configuration

`@gotgenes/pi-subagents` has two configuration surfaces: **agent definition files** that describe an agent type, and a **`subagents.json`** settings file that tunes the runtime.
Neither is required — every field has a default.

For the tools, commands, events, and service API, see the [README](../README.md).

## Default Agent Types

| Type              | Tools                      | Model                         | Prompt Mode            | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `general-purpose` | all 7                      | inherit                       | `append` (parent twin) | Inherits the parent's full system prompt — same rules, CLAUDE.md, project conventions            |
| `Explore`         | read, bash, grep, find, ls | haiku (falls back to inherit) | `replace`              | Fast codebase exploration (read-only); inherits the parent prompt as a base                      |
| `Plan`            | read, bash, grep, find, ls | inherit                       | `replace`              | Software architect for implementation planning (read-only); inherits the parent prompt as a base |

The `general-purpose` agent is a **parent twin** — it receives the parent's entire system prompt plus a sub-agent context bridge, so it follows the same rules the parent does.
Explore and Plan use `replace` mode: the parent prompt is the cacheable base and their specialist read-only instructions are appended last, giving them the final say.

In every mode, a child that runs somewhere other than the parent — one given an isolated workspace by a `WorkspaceProvider` — does not inherit the parent's `Current working directory:` footer.
That line is stripped from the inherited prompt, leaving the fresh footer Pi appends for the child session's own directory as the single, correct claim; without the strip, the child follows the parent's path instead.
A child sharing the parent's directory inherits the prompt untouched, so its prefix stays byte-identical to the parent's.

Default agents can be **overridden** by creating a `.md` file with the same name (e.g. `.pi/agents/general-purpose.md`), or **disabled** per-project with `enabled: false` frontmatter.

## Custom Agents

Define custom agent types by creating `.md` files.
The filename becomes the agent type name.
Any name is allowed — using a default agent's name overrides it.

Agents are discovered from two locations (higher priority wins):

| Priority    | Location                                                                         | Scope                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1 (highest) | `.pi/agents/<name>.md`                                                           | Project — per-repo agents     |
| 2           | `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/agents/<name>.md` (default `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md`) | Global — available everywhere |

Project-level agents override global ones with the same name, so you can customize a global agent for a specific project.
The global location follows the upstream `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` env var — set it to relocate all pi-coding-agent state (agents, skills, settings) to a custom directory.

### Example: `.pi/agents/auditor.md`

```markdown
---
description: Security Code Reviewer
tools: read, grep, find, bash
model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
thinking: high
max_turns: 30
---

You are a security auditor.
Review code for vulnerabilities including:

- Injection flaws (SQL, command, XSS)
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure configurations

Report findings with file paths, line numbers, severity, and remediation advice.
```

Then spawn it like any built-in type:

```text
subagent({ subagent_type: "auditor", prompt: "Review the auth module", description: "Security audit" })
```

### Frontmatter Fields

All fields are optional — sensible defaults for everything.

| Field               | Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `model`             | inherit parent | Model — `provider/modelId` or fuzzy name (`"haiku"`, `"sonnet"`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `inherit_context`   | `false`        | Fork parent conversation into agent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Frontmatter is authoritative.
If an agent file sets `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`, `inherit_context`, or `run_in_background`, those values are locked for that agent.
`subagent` tool parameters only fill fields the agent config leaves unspecified.

### Tool selection

`tools` is the agent's **complete allowlist**, not a filter over the built-ins.
A child session gets exactly the tools it names — nothing else is enabled, whoever registered it.

Entries may name built-in tools (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`) or tools registered by any extension:

```yaml
---
description: Browser-driving researcher
tools: read, grep, find, agent_browser
---
```

Naming an extension's tool is the supported way to give a child access to it.
This matters because a child loads the parent's extensions and runs their setup functions, so an extension **does** call `registerTool` inside the child — and Pi then drops that tool, because the allowlist is applied before the child's tool registry is built.
The registration reports no error; the tool simply is not there.
List the tool by name and it is admitted the moment its extension registers it.

Three names are always removed from a child, even when an agent lists them: `subagent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent`.
This is the recursion guard — without it, an agent could spawn agents of its own without bound.

Accepted forms, all equivalent:

```yaml
tools: read, grep, find      # comma-separated
tools: [read, grep, find]    # YAML flow sequence
tools:                       # YAML block sequence
  - read
  - grep
  - find
tools: none                  # no tools at all
```

Omitting `tools` entirely gives the agent all seven built-ins and no extension tools.

Two other settings interact with this list:

- [`excludedExtensionPackages`](#excluding-package-extensions-from-children) stops an extension from loading in children at all, so naming one of its tools has no effect there.
- When [`@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/tree/main/packages/pi-permission-system) is installed, its `permission:` frontmatter narrows the set further, per turn.
  Use it to deny a tool; use `tools` to decide what the agent has in the first place.

## Persistent Settings

Runtime tuning values set via `/subagents:settings` (max concurrency, default max turns, grace turns, the two session-retention windows, and the abort-on-interrupt policy) persist across pi restarts.
A completed subagent's record is kept for the whole parent session (so `get_subagent_result` never misses); only its heavy in-memory session is released — after `consumedSessionRetentionMinutes` once the result has been collected, or after the `unconsumedSessionRetentionMinutes` safety cap if it never was.
Two files, merged on load:

- **Global:** `~/.pi/agent/subagents.json` — your machine-wide defaults.
  Edit by hand; the `/subagents:settings` command never writes here.
- **Project:** `<cwd>/.pi/subagents.json` — per-project overrides.
  Written by `/subagents:settings`.

**Precedence:** project overrides global on any field present in both.
Missing fields fall back to the hardcoded defaults (max concurrency `4`, default max turns unlimited, grace turns `5`, consumed-session retention `10` minutes, unconsumed-session retention `720` minutes, abort-all-on-interrupt `true`).

**Example — global defaults for a beefy machine:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent
cat > ~/.pi/agent/subagents.json <<'EOF'
{
  "maxConcurrent": 16,
  "graceTurns": 10,
  "unconsumedSessionRetentionMinutes": 1440,
  "abortAllOnInterrupt": false
}
EOF
```

Every project now starts with concurrency 16, grace 10, and ESC left to the parent, without ever touching the command.
Individual projects can still override via `/subagents:settings`.

**Failure behavior:** missing file is silent; malformed JSON logs a `[pi-subagents] Ignoring malformed settings at …` warning to stderr; invalid/out-of-range field values are dropped per-field; write failures downgrade the `/subagents:settings` toast to a warning with `(session only; failed to persist)`.

**Serialized foreground-only mode:** setting `maxConcurrent` to `0` disables background agents entirely — the subagent tool rejects `run_in_background` with guidance to re-run in the foreground, and the RPC service rejects every spawn because its contract returns immediately and cannot serialize an agent against the main session.
The mode targets providers that allow only one in-flight request: a single stream rules out the parent–child request collisions that surface as `429 concurrency_limit_exceeded`.

### Excluding package extensions from children

Some package extensions are parent-scoped or expensive to initialize per session.
Because children run in the parent's process, such an extension initializing once per child multiplies its cost in a single heap — enough, in the case that motivated this feature, to exhaust the V8 heap with four concurrent children.

List the offending packages under `excludedExtensionPackages` to keep their extensions out of child sessions:

```json
{
  "excludedExtensionPackages": ["npm:@cortexkit/pi-magic-context"]
}
```

Entries must match Pi's configured package source string exactly, as it appears in your Pi `settings.json` `packages` array — there is no glob or prefix matching.

What this does and does not do:

- Only the matched packages' **extensions** are disabled, and only in children.
  Their skills, prompts, and themes stay available to children.
- The parent session is unaffected, as is the child's own settings — only the child's resource loading is filtered.
- The exclusion happens during package resolution, so the extension's module is never imported and its factory never runs in the child.
- Excluding a package keeps the **tools** that extension registers out of child sessions too: its factory never runs there, so an agent that names one of those tools in [`tools`](#tool-selection) gets nothing.
  If you need the tools but want the extension's resources released when the child is disposed, exclusion is the wrong lever — see [Child session lifecycle](../README.md#child-session-lifecycle).

This key is hand-edited in the global or project `subagents.json`; `/subagents:settings` does not expose it, but it is preserved when you change other settings there.
An absent or empty list reproduces the default behavior, in which children inherit every parent extension.

#### Excluding a permission extension

When [`@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/tree/main/packages/pi-permission-system) is installed, it rides into children harmlessly by construction, so exclusion is an optimization and never a correctness requirement.
Excluding an extension that only registers an authorizer chain link costs nothing but saves its load time: the node that adjudicates an ask still judges every descendant's request.

One case does weaken a child, and it is worth checking before you add an entry.
An extension can declare the filesystem path *another* package's tool accesses, so that the permission system's `path` and `external_directory` gates can see it.
Excluding such a declaring package leaves the tool present in the child with its path undeclared, and the child's own gates stop seeing it — silently, because the parent's gating is unaffected and still looks correct.

The condition needs both halves, so most exclusions cannot hit it:

- Package **A** registers a tool whose path lives under a non-standard input key.
- Package **B** registers the path extractor for A's tool.
- You exclude **B** but not **A**.

If one package supplies both the tool and its extractor, excluding it removes both together and no gap opens.
Preview formatters split the same way but are cosmetic — they change prompt text, not gating.
Closing or announcing this gap is tracked in [#793](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/issues/793); until then, treat it as a hand check at the moment you add an entry.

Excluding `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` itself is a different matter: a child then loads no permission node at all, so nothing gates its tool calls, no `permission:` frontmatter applies, and no `ask` is forwarded.
See [Subagent Integration](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/blob/main/packages/pi-permission-system/docs/subagent-integration.md#loading-asymmetry) for the full rule.

### Abort on interrupt

By default, pressing ESC to interrupt the parent agent also aborts every subagent.
Set `abortAllOnInterrupt` to `false` (or flip it from `/subagents:settings`) to keep background and queued subagents running when you interrupt the parent — useful when you spawn long background work and then want to steer the parent without losing it.

A foreground agent aborts on ESC regardless of this setting.
It holds the parent's own run signal for the duration of its blocking tool call, so the interrupt reaches it directly; the policy governs background and queued agents.

The policy is read at the moment ESC fires, so flipping it mid-session applies to the very next interrupt.
