/**
 * glyphs.ts — the semantic display-glyph vocabulary for the agent UI.
 *
 * Pi's TUI sizes each terminal cell with `get-east-asian-width`, which reports
 * one cell for every glyph below. A glyph that no monospace font covers is
 * therefore drawn by a proportional fallback font whose advance overruns that
 * cell and collides with the next column — the defect in #669. East Asian Width
 * does not detect this: the offending glyph and its replacement are both width 1.
 *
 * Before adding or changing a glyph, measure its monospace coverage:
 *
 *   fc-list ":charset=<codepoint>:spacing=100" family | cut -d, -f1 | sort -u | grep -v LastResort
 *
 * Coverage on macOS 15, counted in families:
 *
 *   ✓ U+2713 success        6
 *   ✗ U+2717 failure        6
 *   ▸ U+25B8 tool call      6
 *   ■ U+25A0 stopped        9
 *   ● U+25CF agents active  9
 *   ○ U+25CB agents idle    9
 *   ◦ U+25E6 queued         9
 *   ⎿ U+23BF sub-line       0  — pi house style, tracked in #683
 *   ◍ U+25CD streaming      1  (Menlo), tracked in #683
 *   ⠋…⠏ spinner frames      0  — pi house style, tracked in #683
 *
 * Retired from the vocabulary: ↻ U+21BB and ⇊ U+21CA (1 monospace family
 * each) and the unmeasured ≤ — a fallback-font advance overrun on glyphs in
 * the widget's status row broke the chat box border on terminals whose font
 * lacks coverage. Turn and compaction counts now render as ASCII
 * ("2/40 turns", "+2 compactions") in `display.ts`.
 *
 * Glyphs are written here as literal characters rather than `\uXXXX` escapes, so
 * a non-ASCII scan of `src/` (`rg -n '[^\x00-\x7f]' src --glob '*.ts'`) surfaces
 * this file plus only layout and punctuation. Box-drawing characters stay at
 * their render sites: they are layout, not vocabulary.
